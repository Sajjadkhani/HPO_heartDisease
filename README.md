# Heart Disease Prediction Improvement with AutoML

The goal is to conduct Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) for heart disease prediction using AutoML tools, including Auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and SMAC.

## Environment Setup with Requirement Files

Requirement files to run the notebooks are located in the `env` folder. To create an Conda environment from a requirement file, use the following command, replacing `environment_name.yml` with the appropriate file name:`conda env create -f environment_name.yml`
Alternatively, you can conda install the packages using their official websites. It's important to install these libraries in distinct environments to avoid compatibility issues.

## Hyperparameter Optimization

The code for doing model selection using AutoGluon and AutoSklearn and HPO with SMAC is available in the `notebook` folder.
